## React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates an intermittent rendering issue with the FlatList component in React Native.  The application fetches data from a public API and displays it using FlatList.  However, under certain circumstances (not consistently reproducible), the FlatList fails to render all or any of the fetched data, resulting in a blank screen or incomplete display. 

This issue is likely related to data handling, asynchronous operations, or state management within the React component.
